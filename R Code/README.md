# R Code   
This code is here as a way for newer programmers to use R to analyze the data generated from the NEURON simulations (especially the larger 20,000+ rows of csv data when saving state values from a simulation). There is no particular direction with this code, and that's on purpose. Analyzing data doesn't have a striaght forward cookie cutter procedure, so neither does this code. The Snippets.R and UsefulFunctions.R are a bunch of little tools to help generate graphs and dataframes for analyzing the data. Hopefully you will find it useful.  
If you already know how to use R then you are probably better off without this code (but you might get use from UsefulFunctions.R), but if you are newer to R you may find it useful.
