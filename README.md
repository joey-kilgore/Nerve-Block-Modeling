# NEURON
Nerve Block Modeling

This code utilizes the NEURON program to create simulations of High Frequency Alternating Current (HFAC) to block action potentials. The main models here are created from the MRG model. By creating simulations, millions of tests can be ran one after another contuosly, allowing for testing of multiple different types of waveforms, on different fiber diameters, with different electrodes. Hopefully, this will allow us to get a better insight on the potential of HFAC on nerve block.
