# Python Scripts  
These Python scripts are used on top of NEURON. The biggest problem when trying to run numerous (>10) simulations in NEURON is that the workload is run linearly, even though many simulations could be run in parrallel. In an attempt to improve efficiency, and maximize computing resources, these python scripts are used. For any large simulation, a master script is written, and from that numerous sub processes are created. By doing this, the initially workload is spread out, and each sub process runs its own instance of NEURON.  
 
The MultiThreadTest.py and RunHoc.py show how this master process and sub process system can improve efficiency. The MultiThreadTest.py is the master process, and its only job is to spread the workload across multiple instances of the RunHoc.py script. To tell each sub process which set of parameter to test, each sub process is passed a list of arguments, which the RunHoc.py script reads. The RunHoc.py script then creates an instance of NEURON and then passes the parameters as a hoc command to NEURON. From there the output can be redirected from the console to a file.
