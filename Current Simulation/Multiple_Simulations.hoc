// Multiple_Simulations is a compilation of multiple tests each having a specific purpose
// These tests are not meant to be run from a UI but are instead a pre defined set of instructions
//  that will often run multiple simulations and from this try and show some effect in the simulatins
//  They could be as simple as finding a block threshold across changing frequencies or changing diameters
//  The point is that these procedures are set simulations each having a specific experiment they conduct
